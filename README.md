## About
Workout tracker/planner to plan and record your workouts.
I couldn't find any iOS app that freely lets you plan and log your workouts without subscribing or buying pre-made workout plans.
Was hoping to develop a Go backend, that connects to a native app on a mobile device.
## Techstack
- Go
    - sqlx
    - httprouter

... to be planned
